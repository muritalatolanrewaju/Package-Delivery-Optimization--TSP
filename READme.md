# Package Delivery Optimization using TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)

## Overview
This project aims to solve a real-world package delivery problem using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a basis. The goal is to optimize the delivery routes for a truck fleet to minimize the distance traveled while meeting various constraints such as delivery time windows, truck capacities, and special package requirements.

## Features
- **Route Optimization:** Utilizes the 2-opt algorithm to find the most efficient route for each truck.
- **Time Complexity:** Efficiently calculates the time taken for each route and updates package statuses in real-time.
- **Dynamic Loading:** Packages are dynamically loaded onto trucks based on various constraints.
- **User Interface:** Provides a colorful terminal interface to display package statuses and delivery details.
- **Time-based Queries:** Allows users to query the status of all packages at a specific time or within a time range.
- **Package-specific Queries:** Allows users to query the status of a specific package at a specific time.

## Project Assumptions
- Each truck can carry up to 16 packages.
- Trucks travel at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Three trucks and two drivers are available.
- Drivers leave the hub by 8:00 a.m.
- Delivery and loading times are instantaneous.
- The delivery address for package #9 will be corrected at 10:20 a.m.
- Distances are equal regardless of the direction traveled.
- The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run python main.py to start the program.
